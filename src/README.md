# SoilSync AI: System Navigation Guide

**SoilSync AI** is a precision agriculture platform designed to transform soil health management for Kenyan smallholder farmers by integrating AI, SoilHive platform data, real-time environmental inputs, and farmer feedback. It addresses soil degradation, nutrient imbalances, and limited data access, targeting a **15-30% yield increase**, **22% fertilizer cost reduction**, and **0.4 tons CO2/ha carbon sequestration**.

## How to Run the Application

### Access the Platform
- Visit: **[https://kenyasoil-advisor.lovable.app/](https://kenyasoil-advisor.lovable.app/)**
- Create an account using your **phone number or email** and select your preferred language (English, Swahili, or other local languages).
- Enable **offline mode** for areas with limited connectivity, allowing data syncing when internet is available.

### Usage
1. **Input Farm Details**: Enter farm location, crop type, and management practices in the **Farm Profile** section.
2. **Soil Health Assessment**: Use the **Soil Diagnostic** tool to analyze soil data from SoilHive (75,505 testing points), IoT sensors, and satellite imagery.
3. **Receive Tailored Recommendations**: View crop-specific fertilizer and management recommendations in the **Recommendations** tab, downloadable as PDFs.
4. **Monitor Soil Health**: Track real-time soil changes (NDVI, moisture, pH) via the **Monitoring Dashboard**.
5. **Engage with Support Features**: Use the **voice assistant** (in local languages) or **community section** for peer support and extension services.
6. **Review Impact and Analytics**: Check the **Impact** section for yield improvements, cost savings, and environmental metrics.
